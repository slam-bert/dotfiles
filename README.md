# dotfiles

This was the setup I used the first time I used Gentoo, this repo will not be maintained in any capacity.

Configuration files for my computer. Will (most likely) not be kept up to date.

Will most likely work on all distros, but do expect issues.

The configuration files added here are, as follows:

1: berrywm
2: bspwm
3: neofetch
4: picom
5: urxvt/rxvt-unicode
5: xinitrc
6: Xresources

I'm only using this repository for personal use, so do my defaults may not suit you.
